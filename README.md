Built and trained a convolutional neural network from scratch using Keras to classify signals from space.
<br/>The data used consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute.
<br/>Here I treat the spectrograms as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes.<br/>
